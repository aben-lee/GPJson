The GPJSON Format Specification

——Json Format for Geophysics Specification


Abstract: GPJSON which derived from GeoJSON is only for encoding geophysical sensor source structures based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It defines several types of JSON objects and the manner in which they are combined to represent a tree-table structure (the tree structure represent base information and table structure present sensor source in geophysical source acquisition and process). It also defines several types of JSON objects and the manner in which they are combined to represent could represent a concrete binary metadata (in string format in json) or link external file (local or URL). The goal of GPJSON is to integrate the geoscience source compatible with existing GeoJSON format and to parse and transmit source from client (remote acquisition) to server (processing and interpretation) easily. 
Note: Geoarch is a geoscience source processing platform focusing on Source-flow diagram schemes.
